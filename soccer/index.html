	Soccer, also known as football in many parts of the world, is a global sport that is loved and played by millions of people. 
	  It is a team sport played between two teams, with each team consisting of eleven players. 
	  The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team. 
	  Soccer is a highly skilled game that requires speed, agility, coordination, and strategic thinking. 
	  The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end, and the players use their feet to kick the ball and maneuver it across 
	  the field. Soccer is not only a sport, but it also serves as a medium for cultural exchange and social interaction. 
	  The World Cup, held every four years, is one of the most significant sporting events in the world and brings together people 
	  from all over the globe to celebrate the sport of soccer.
