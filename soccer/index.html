	<p>Soccer, also known as football in many parts of the world, is a global sport that is loved and played by millions of people. 
	  It is a team sport played between two teams, with each team consisting of eleven players. </p>
	 <p> The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team. 
	  Soccer is a highly skilled game that requires speed, agility, coordination, and strategic thinking.
